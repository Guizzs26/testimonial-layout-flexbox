## My process

### Built with ⚒️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned 🧠

🚀 The main objective of this project was to build a “complex” layout using only CSS Flexbox, even though the challenge was to do it using CSS Grid

😍 But with this project I also learned a bit and put responsive design into practice

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This was my main source of knowledge for building this project
